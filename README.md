- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ayomidejoe.
My background is in medicine, public health, and digital health. I have had experience working as a clinician and public health physician in Nigeria. 
I have also built digital health products for Nigeria and other African countries. 
I just finished a PhD in health informatics at the University of Illinois Chicago, focusing on AI/ML applications in healthcare.
